## Regata


Regata is two things

1. A from-scratch implementation of regular language expressions, deterministic finite automata (DFA), non-deterministic finite automata (NFA) and regular expression matching in terms of DFA evaluation.

2. A tool for the visualization of the minimal DFA for a given regular langugage expression and its evaluation of it on a given string

Some features are:

* DFA and NFA duplication
* DFA NFA iteration
* Regular language expression randomization for a given depth
